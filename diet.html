  <p>These are carnivorous animals and will feed on almost any animal from rodents through to large ungulates. However, larger animals such as deer, antelope, wild boar, and buffalo form the largest part of their diet. An adult female lion needs about 5kg of meat per day, a male about 7kg but they can gorge up to twice this amount when food is scarce.</p>
