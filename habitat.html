  <p>Habitat stuff...</p>
  <p>Dry scrubland and open deciduous forest habitats. This species used to be found across the whole of Northern Africa, south west Asia and northern Greece. Today, there are only around 350 individuals left, found only in the Gir forest reserve in Gujarat, northern India. There are plans to reintroduce some to a reserve in Madhya Pradesh.</p>
